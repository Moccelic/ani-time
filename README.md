# Ani-Time
**Ani-Time** is a lightweight Firefox extension that quietly tracks how much time you spend watching anime across popular streaming sites like Crunchyroll, Netflix, and HIDIVE.  
No accounts. No syncing. No spying.  
Just a private, local log of your anime viewing habits — for the curious, the completionists, and the truly dedicated.

## Features
- **Automatic Tracking**: Logs time whenever you visit anime episodes on supported sites.
- **Local & Private**: Stores all data in your browser’s local storage — no external servers or accounts needed.
- **Minimal Interface**: Clean, no-frills popup displaying your total watch time by show.
- **Easy to Use**: Installs in minutes, runs quietly in the background.

## Installation
1. **Temporary Install** (for testing/development):
   - Clone or download this repo.
   - Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging`.
   - Click on **“This Firefox”** → **“Load Temporary Add-on”** → select `manifest.json`.
   - The Ani-Time icon should appear in your toolbar.

2. **(Coming Soon) Add-on Store**:
   - Once published, you can install it directly from the Firefox Add-ons site.

## Usage
1. After installing, **browse to any supported site** (Crunchyroll, Netflix, HIDIVE).
2. Ani-Time detects anime-related pages and starts timing automatically.
3. **Open the extension popup** anytime to see how many hours/minutes you’ve spent per show.
4. That’s it! There’s a **Clear Log** button if you ever want to reset all data.

## Privacy
- Ani-Time **never sends your data anywhere** — all tracking is local to your browser.
- You can clear or remove Ani-Time at any time, wiping all stored watch-time data.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add more granular site/domain support  
- [ ] Implement daily/weekly summaries
