# ani-time
Ani-Time is a lightweight Firefox extension that quietly tracks how much time you spend watching anime across popular streaming sites like Crunchyroll, Netflix, and HIDIVE.  No accounts. No syncing. No spying. Just a private, local log of your anime viewing habits â€” for the curious, the completionists, and the truly dedicated.
